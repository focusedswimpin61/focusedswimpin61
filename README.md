# Hi, I'm Tejas Sharma

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a dedicated Computer Science student at Arizona State University (ASU) with a strong focus on backend development. I enjoy crafting scalable and secure systems that provide robust solutions for real-world problems.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing my BS in Computer Science at ASU, where I continuously seek to expand my understanding of software engineering principles, data management, and cloud-based architectures. I have a deep passion for building efficient backend systems—whether that's designing RESTful APIs, optimizing database interactions, or exploring server-side technologies.

## Technical Interests

- **Backend Development:** I'm particularly interested in server-side programming, database optimization, and creating reliable APIs.
- **Cloud & Microservices:** I love experimenting with cloud platforms and microservice architectures to build scalable solutions.
- **Clean Code:** I believe in writing code that is not only functional but also maintainable and well-documented.

## Education

- **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**  
  _Arizona State University (ASU)_

## Hobbies & Interests

When I'm not coding, you can find me at the piano. Playing music allows me to unwind and fuels my creativity, which often inspires innovative problem-solving in my technical projects.
